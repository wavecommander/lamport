### User/Team Management system
- A directory and light management portal

Web interface:
- Public team directory page with public level info
- Login/Authentication page
- Admin page
	- Inbox and archive
- Form submission
	- Form validation rules

PostgreSQL DB:
- User table
	- Some data is sensitive/confidential (contact details)
- Mailing list table
- Produce yearly report of diff in data

Integrations:
- GitHub Organization management via API
- Slack Workspace management via API


Form templates (? might have misunderstood scope of requirement):
- Allow creation of multiple form types
	- Start by duplicating a previous form type
- Should be a very simple, hopefully standardized format
	- Markdown form extension?
