* Enable management of a Slack workspace membership

You are meeting with the development team, and your task is to present a possible approach to develop this system.

##### **Assignment Requirements**

1. Design a solution : based on the information provided, develop a high level design of a possible working solution to be presented to your team in order to start implementing this software system. You have complete autonomy in suggesting possible technologies for use in this product.

2. Prototype: In support of your proposal, you can use some prototype code to implement some significant parts of the solution, in order to showcase them to the rest of the team.

3. Consider possible extensions: Be prepared to consider how the proposed solution might evolve. How is the lifecycle of the different components managed?
   How can we evolve the database schema? …
